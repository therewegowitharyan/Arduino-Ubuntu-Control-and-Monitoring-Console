# Arduino-Ubuntu-System-Controller
Control system volume, brightness, and mouse with Arduino inputs, while monitoring CPU temperature and RAM usage.

### Control your Linux system using Arduino — Volume, Brightness, and Mouse — while monitoring CPU Temperature and RAM usage in real time.
### Overview:
            This project bridges **Arduino** with **Ubuntu** using a **Python serial interface**.  
It allows you to:
- 🎚️ Control system **volume** via potentiometer  
- 💡 Adjust **screen brightness** that too via potentiometer
- 🖱️ Move your **mouse pointer** and click using a joystick  
- 🌡️ View **CPU temperature** and **RAM usage** represented by LEDs and servo motor **in real time**.
